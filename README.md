# Data Structures using Python
***This Repo is the Solutions of Assignment-1 of DSA Bridge Course, which is a mandatory course for all M.Tech. CSE, M.Tech. AI and M.Tech. DCS students and offered in Fall 2021, Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur.***

Here I have uploaded the implementations of basic data structures using Python language. The Repo includes programs of
- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Circular Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Double Ended Queue
- Priority Queue
- Circular Queue
- Binary Search Tree

All the codes are Menu Driven and all the implementations use Singly Linked List. In addition to all these, there is another program implemented in Python using Singly Linked List named as ```StudentData.py```. This program is used to store Student's data and there are utility functions to perform CRUD operations.

**The C Implementations of the same have been uploaded in a seperate [Repository](https://github.com/ayan-cs/data-structures-c).**
